# DM Tools

DM Tools is a comprehensive toolset designed for Dungeon Masters to enhance and streamline their tabletop role-playing game (RPG) sessions. This app offers a range of functionalities, including audio management, effect organization, and content generation for your game settings. Built using Angular 18 and Firebase, DM Tools provides a modern, feature-rich experience for all your session needs.

## Features

### Audio Management
DM Tools allows you to manage your audio resources, such as background music, ambience, and sound effects, providing an immersive experience for your players.

- **YouTube Integration**: Import music and ambience directly from YouTube videos to enrich your game atmosphere.
- **Headers and Presets**: Organize your music and ambience into different headers within customizable presets. This allows you to quickly switch between different audio settings based on the campaign or specific scenarios (e.g., battle, exploration, tavern).
- **Simultaneous Music and Ambience**: You can play both music and ambience tracks simultaneously, creating a dynamic and layered sound environment.

#### Example:
- You can create a "City" preset with ambient city sounds and play background music to suit the bustling urban atmosphere.
- You can switch to a "Wilderness" preset to quickly adjust to nature sounds when players leave the city.

### Effects Tab
The effects tab allows you to upload and manage sound effects to play during your game sessions. You can create different effect groups, which act as categories to organize your effects (e.g., "City Sounds", "Wilderness", etc.).

- **Upload Effects**: Upload audio files to the app and use them for special in-game moments.
- **Effect Groups**: Create multiple effect groups for various scenes, making it easy to find the right sounds during a session.
- **Play Effects On-Demand**: Quickly play effects when you need them, such as battle cries, fire crackling, or a cat meowing.

### Generation Tab
DM Tools also provides a robust content generation toolset, allowing you to create rich content for your campaign on-the-fly. The generator tab includes the following features:

#### Tavern Generator
- **Generate Unique Taverns**: Create unique taverns with detailed descriptions, including both the outside and inside appearance.
- **Innkeeper and Menu**: Automatically generate the name and personality of the innkeeper, as well as a menu of food and drinks available at the tavern.
- **Markdown Copy**: You can copy the entire tavern description in Markdown format, making it easy to integrate into your game notes or campaign guides.

#### Store Generator
- **Generate Unique Stores**: Generate detailed descriptions of stores, including their appearance and shopkeeper.
- **Manage Inventory**: Generate items that are available in the store, which you can edit by adding or removing items based on your session’s requirements.
- **Markdown Copy**: Similar to the tavern, you can copy store details to Markdown for easy documentation.

#### NPC Generator
- **Generate NPCs with Stat Blocks**: Create non-player characters (NPCs) complete with race, class, level, and a full stat block.
- **Markdown Copy**: The generated NPCs can be copied in Markdown format, allowing for easy integration into your game notes.

#### Name Generator
- **Generate Character and Place Names**: Input keywords to generate a list of fantasy-inspired names for characters and places.
- **Keyword-Based Names**: Generated names match the theme and characteristics you provide, making it easy to find fitting names for your NPCs and locations.

### Notes Section
Managing in-game notes has never been easier.
- **Haphazard to Cohesive**: Write down session notes during the game in your natural language, even if they’re haphazard or scattered.
- **Summarize with Markdown**: Click the "Summarize" button to transform your raw notes into a cohesive summary with proper Markdown formatting. This feature enhances clarity and helps you keep better records of your campaign.

## How to Use DM Tools
1. **Audio Management**: Set up your presets for different settings, import YouTube links for music, and organize your effects.
2. **Generation**: Use the generator to create taverns, stores, NPCs, and names on demand, enriching your game world.
3. **Notes Management**: Write notes during your sessions and use the summarizer to turn them into clean, formatted summaries.
